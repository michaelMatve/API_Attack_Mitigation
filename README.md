<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

With the increasing prevalence of API servers, the number of attacks targeting them has also grown. This highlights the necessity for an API Attack Mitigation system that safeguards both the server and its users. To address this need, we conducted thorough research and developed an easy-to-use protection system that offers effective defense.

Here's why:
* you want to protect your server
* you want to protect the user and his information
* you want to protect your server
* it needs to easy-to-use and fixable.

Our project focuses on creating a Python package for an API Attack Mitigation layer. This package enables developers to easily add a security layer to their API servers, effectively protecting them against malicious attacks. 


We analyzed API attacks and existing solutions, finding that most focus on low-level detection like firewalls. While effective, these solutions are complex and inflexible. To address this, we developed a Python library leveraging ModSecurity's rules database. Our high-level approach offers greater flexibility and user-friendliness.
Our Python library supports Flask and FastAPI servers and can be adapted for other API interfaces using the adapter design pattern. Leveraging an active ModSecurity rules database, our library stays up-to-date for effective request classification.
With its capability to detect and block a wide range of API attacks such as SQL injection, RCE, directory traversal, XSS, and more, our library provides comprehensive protection. To offer users detailed diagnosis, we generate a log file that tracks every request.
